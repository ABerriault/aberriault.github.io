---
The List is a reminder of all the things that I have completed and accomplished in life. Often it can be easy to remember all the times that you messed up, the times that you were embarrassed, or the times that you felt that you failed. But often these failures were learning opportunities that lead to new success and accomplishments. Remembering your success and how you got there is important for your long term growth and humility. Understanding that you didn't just wake up like this can go a long way for your empathy of others and yourself during hardship. It is my belief that people are defined by their adversity and their ability to perform regardless of situation.

Everyone experiences difficulty and while some are empirically more intense than others, it is difficult to fully understand the situation of someone other than yourself. While this means you should be understanding of others, it does not mean that everyone gets a free pass. This includes yourself. You are the only one who can understand your hardship and your success fully. This means that you must hold yourself to a higher standard. 

*This list includes anything I feel is not a common experience*

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts &quot;Hi, #{name}&quot;
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
