                        A bunch of content that is going to fill the only portion of the front of the site that can change. 
                        This is information that I will update as my intentions for the site change. 
                        This information is the paragraph that is in the upper section of the main page. 
                        It should be a few sentences long and contain detailed information, hooking the site viewer to explore 
                        one of the three other pages above! Projects is where I have posts about projects I have completed and 
                        information for each including Github links. The about page has information about me including my resume. 
                        The contact page allows you to get a in touch.
